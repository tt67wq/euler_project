// # Problem
// 5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.
// 5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.
// Let `S(L)` be the sum of the numbers `n` not exceeding `L` such that Euler's totient function
// `phi(n)` is a Hamming number. `S(100)=3728`.
//
// Find `S(10^12)`. Give your answer modulo `2^32`.

// # Algorithm
// The three fundamental properties of `phi` are (see
// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function ): (1) `phi(p) = p - 1` if `p` is prime
// (2) `phi(p^k) = p^{k-1} * (p - 1)` if `p` is prime
// (3) `phi(xy) = phi(x) * phi(y)` if `x` and `y` are coprime
//
// A 5-smooth Hamming number can be written as `2^a 3^b 5^c`.
// From (1) follows that if the successor of a Hamming number is prime, then that prime has a
// totient which is a Hamming number: (4) `phi(2^a 3^b 5^c + 1) = 2^a 3^b 5^c` if `2^a 3^b 5^c + 1`
// is prime
//
// From (2) and (3) follows that the totient of each Hamming number is a Hamming number, too:
// (5) `phi(2^a 3^b 5^c) = phi(2^a) * phi(3^b) * phi(5^c)`
// (6) `= 2^{a-1} * (2-1) * 3^{b-1} * (3-1) * 5^{c-1} * (5-1)`
// (7) `= 2^{a-1} *         3^{b-1} *   2   * 5^{c-1} *   4`
// (8) `= 2^{a+2} *         3^{b-1} *         5^{c-1}`
//
// And from (3) and (4) follows that if the totient of two primes `p_1` and `p_2` is a Hamming
// numbers each, then their product is a Hamming number as well: (9) `phi(p_1 p_2) = phi(p_1) *
// phi(p_2)` (10) `= 2^{a_1} 3^{b_1} 5^{c_1} * 2^{a_2} 3^{b_2} 5^{c_2}` (11) `= 2^{a_1 + a_2} 3^{b_1
// + b_2} 5^{c_1 + c_2}`
//
// This applies not only to the product of two primes but also to the product of any number of
// (distinct) primes with a Hamming totient. To avoid further confusion: let's assume that all those
// primes are bigger than 5.
//
// Multiplying each such product by `2^k` produces another Hamming number because:
// (12) `phi(2^k p_1 p_2) = phi(2^k) * phi(p) = 2^{k-1} * phi(p)`
// Multiplying each such product by `3^k` produces another Hamming number because:
// (13) `phi(3^k p) = phi(3^k) * phi(p) = 3^{k-1} * 2 * phi(p)`
// Multiplying each such product by `5^k` produces another Hamming number because:
// (14) `phi(5^k p) = phi(5^k) * phi(p) = 5^{k-1} * 2^2 * phi(p)`
//
// In general: since 2, 3 and 5 are coprime, multiplying each such product by `2^a 3^b 5^c` produces
// another Hamming number (see (3) ).
//
// The algorithm now looks as follows:
// - find all Hamming numbers up to `10^12` and store them in ''hamming'' (3428 numbers)
// - find all prime numbers that are the successor of a Hamming number and store them in ''primes''
// (545 numbers)
// - multiply all values of ''primes'' in every possible way, but each prime must appear at most
// once per product (and obviously the product must not exceed `10^12`).
// - multiply each such product by all Hamming numbers (again: not exceeding `10^12`)
//
// # Note
// I wasn't sure whether I could have missed a few numbers whose totient is a Hamming number, too.
// My program found the correct value for `S(100)` so I hoped for the best - and indeed, my result
// for `S(10^12)` was correct.
//
// The main loop processes a queue of all prime number products.
// Initially I was keen on keeping the queue sorted but soon discovered that it doesn't matter.
// Even more, it doesn't matter which numbers you process first: processing the last (= largest)
// numbers first is faster and saves memory, too, because the queue doesn't grow too much.
//
// Almost all of my solutions which need a prime test either use a simple prime sieve or my
// implementation of the Miller-Rabin test. Since the Miller-Rabin test is more than 100 lines long
// and not easily understandable, I often hesitate to include it. This time I decided to give my
// wheel-based prime test a chance (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_factorization , it's
// part of my [toolbox](/toolbox/), too).
